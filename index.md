This project aims at building a machine learning model that can use the information about the applicants in their credit report to predict whether they will repay their Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)  account. This prediction result is then used to decide whether the homeowner qualifies for a line of credit and, if so, how much credit should be extended.
