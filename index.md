## Predictive Analytics

- [Google Stock Price Trends Prediction with LSTM](https://github.com/norahyyu/Stock-price-prediction-using-LSTM/blob/master/Google%20Stock%20Price%20Trends%20Predictions%20using%20LSTM%20.ipynb)

Built a LSTM-based RNN model to capture the downward and upward trends of Google stock price. The model is robust and achieved 86.6% RSME. As we can see, the prediction lags behind the real values, because the model cannot react fast to non-linear changes. But on the other hand, the model reacts well to smooth changes and manages to follow upwards and downward trends.
